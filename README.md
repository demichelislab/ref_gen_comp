# Figures repository 
Repository storing code for reproducing the figures present in the manuscript "Cherchi et al., bioRxiv (2025) - T2T-CHM13 reference genome reduces mapping bias and enhances alignment accuracy at disease-associated variants" (doi to add).

R Markdown codes are stored in the folder `markdown` and include the following:

- Figure_1.Rmd : Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2
- Figure_Supplementary_3.Rmd:  Supplementary Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4
- Figure_2.Rmd : Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 5
- Figure_3.Rmd : Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 6

Single panels are automatically saved in subfolders within `markdown`.

Panels were minimally post-processed with Inkscape. The code for reproducing Figure 3D panels will be added in a new repository as it includes a novel adaptation of Gviz R library for the visualization of variants.
