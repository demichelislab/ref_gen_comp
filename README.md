# Figures repository 
Repository storing code for reproducing the figures present in the manuscript "Cherchi et al., bioRxiv (2025) - T2T-CHM13 reference genome reduces mapping bias and enhances alignment accuracy at disease-associated variants" (doi:[10.64898/2025.12.17.694618](https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.17.694618)).

R Markdown codes are stored in the folder `markdown` and include the following:

| Markdown | Figures |
| --- | --- |
| Figure_1.Rmd | Figure 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E\nSupplementary Figure S1A, S1B \nSupplementary Figure S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D, S2E |
| Figure_Supplementary_3.Rmd| Supplementary Figure S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, S3E, S3F\nSupplementary Figure S4A, S4B, S4C, S4D, S4E |
| Figure_2.Rmd| Figure 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D\nSupplementary Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D |
| Figure_3.Rmd| Figure 3A, 3B, 3C\nSupplementary Figure 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E |

Single panels are automatically saved in subfolders within `markdown`.

Panels were minimally post-processed with Inkscape. The code for reproducing Figure 3D panels will be added in a new repository as it includes a novel adaptation of Gviz R library for the visualization of variants.
